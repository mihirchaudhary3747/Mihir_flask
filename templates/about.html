        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am an MCA student with a strong interest in Data Science, Python programming, and web development. I enjoy working with data, building analytical projects, and creating simple yet effective web applications using Flask.

        I have hands-on experience with Python, Pandas, NumPy, and basic machine learning concepts, and I continuously improve my skills through practice projects and internships. Along with data analysis, I am also learning full-stack fundamentals to understand how data-driven applications are designed and deployed.

        This portfolio represents my learning journey, projects, and experiments in Data Science and web development. I am currently seeking entry-level opportunities where I can apply my skills, learn from real-world projects, and grow as a professional.</p>
